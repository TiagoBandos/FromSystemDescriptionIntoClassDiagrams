You can use the following PlantUML code:\n\n```\n@startuml\nclass Person {\n  name: String\n  age: int\n}\n\nclass Car {\n  make: String\n  model: String\n}\n\nPerson \"1\" -- \"0..1\" Car : \"owns\"\n@enduml\n```\n\nIn this example, the association between `Person` and `Car` is labeled as \"owns\", and the role names are \"1\" for the `Person` and \"0..1\" for the `Car`.\n\nYou can also use different types of associations, such as aggregation or composition, by using the appropriate symbols (`*--` for aggregation, `*>--` for composition, etc.).",

      "25.23 Migration notes 25 PREPROCESSING startuml theme spacelab class Example { Theme spacelab } enduml You will find more information on the dedicated page. 25.23 Migration notes The current preprocessor is an update from some legacy preprocessor. Even if some legacy features are still supported with the actual preprocessor, you should not use them any more (they might be removed in some long term future).  You should not usedefine and definelong anymore. Use function, procedure or variable definition instead.  define should be replaced by returnfunction  definelong should be replaced byprocedure.  include now allows multiple inclusions : you dont have to useinclude_many anymore  include now accepts a URL, so you dont needincludeurl  Some features (likedate) have been replaced by builtin functions (for exampledate())  When calling a legacydefinelong macro with no arguments, you do have to use parenthesis. You have to usemy_own_definelong() because my_own_definelong without parenthesis is not recognized by the new preprocessor. Please contact us if you have any issues. 25.24 splitstr builtin function startmindmap list  splitstr(abcdefghi, )  root foreach item in list  item endfor endmindmap Similar to: PlantUML Language Reference Guide (1.2025.0) 554 606",
