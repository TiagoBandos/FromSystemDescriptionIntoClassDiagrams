Even if some legacy features are still supported with the actual preprocessor, you should not use them any more (they might be removed in some long term future).  You should not usedefine and definelong anymore. Use function, procedure or variable definition instead.  define should be replaced by returnfunction  definelong should be replaced byprocedure.  include now allows multiple inclusions : you dont have to useinclude_many anymore  include now accepts a URL, so you dont needincludeurl  Some features (likedate) have been replaced by builtin functions (for exampledate())  When calling a legacydefinelong macro with no arguments, you do have to use parenthesis. You have to usemy_own_definelong() because my_own_definelong without parenthesis is not recognized by the new preprocessor.
