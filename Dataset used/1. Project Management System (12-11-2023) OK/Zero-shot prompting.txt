You are a software engineer who is creating a < project management system > who has several years of experience in created class diagram models from requirements specification.
Based on UML rules and principles, create a class diagram model for this requirements: 
    The project manager leads a team to execute the project within the project's start and end dates.
    Once the project is created in the project management system, a manager may initiate and later terminate the project due to its completion or for some other reason.
    The team executes the project.
    Requirements is the input of a project.
    As outputs the project shall produce a system.
    Requirements and systems are work products.
    Work product has a description, information of the percentage of work completed, and may be validated.
    The validation is depending on the type of work product.
    The requirements are validated with users in workshops.
    System are validated by being tested against the requirements.
    The requirements may be published using various types of media, including on an intranet or paper form.
    Systems may be deployed onto specific plataforms. 

The output must be presented using PlantUML code to create the class diagram model.


Relations between classes:
Type	Symbol	Purpose
Extension	<|--	Specialization of a class in a hierarchy
Implementation	<|..	Realization of an interface by a class
Composition	*--	The part cannot exist without the whole
Aggregation	o--	The part can exist independently of the whole
Dependency	-->	The object uses another object
Dependency	..>	A weaker form of dependency

You are a software engineer who is creating a < project management system > who has several years of experience in created class diagram models from requirements specification.
Based on UML rules and principles, create a class diagram model for this requirements: 
A project manager uses the project management system to manage a project. The project manager leads a team to execute the project within the project's start and end dates. Once a project is created in the project management system, a manager may initiate and later terminate the project due to its completion or for some other reason. As input, a project uses requirements. As output, a project produces a system (or part of a system). The requirements and system are work products: things that are created, used, updated, and elaborated on throughout a project. Every work product has a description, is of some percent complete throughout the effort, and may be validated. However, validation is dependent on the type of work product. For example, the requirements are validated with users in workshops, and the system is validated by being tested against the requirements. Furthermore, requirements may be published using various types of media, including on an intranet or in paper form; and systems may be deployed onto specific platforms.

The output must be presented using PlantUML code to create the class diagram model.
