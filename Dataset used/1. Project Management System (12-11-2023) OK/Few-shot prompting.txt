You are a software engineer who is creating a < project management system > who has several years of experience in created class diagram models from requirements specification.
Based on UML rules and principles, create a class diagram model for this requirements: 
    The project manager leads a team to execute the project within the project's start and end dates.
    Once the project is created in the project management system, a manager may initiate and later terminate the project due to its completion or for some other reason.
    The team executes the project.
    Requirements is the input of a project.
    As outputs the project shall produce a system.
    Requirements and systems are work products.
    Work product has a description, information of the percentage of work completed, and may be validated.
    The validation is depending on the type of work product.
    The requirements are validated with users in workshops.
    System are validated by being tested against the requirements.
    The requirements may be published using various types of media, including on an intranet or paper form.
    Systems may be deployed onto specific plataforms. 

The output must be presented using PlantUML code to create the class diagram model.

Here are some examples of how you should create the class diagram class:

Input Requirements: 
    Build a software application to manage filmed scenes for realizing a movie, by following the "Hollywood Approach".
    Every scene shall be identified by a code and it is described by a text in natural language.
    Every scene is filmed at least from one different position.
    Each position is a setup.
    Setup is characterized by a code (a string) and a text in natural language where the photographic parameters are noted (e.g., aperture, exposure, focal length, filters, etc.)
    Each setup is related to a single scene 
    Every setup has at least one take filmed in.
    A take has a positive natural number, a real number representing the number of meters of film that have been used for shooting the take, and the code (string) of the reel where the film is stored.
    A take is associated to a single setup.
    Scenes can be internals, filmed in a theater, or a externals, filmed in a location and can either be "day scene" or "night scene".
    Location have a code (string), an address of the location and a text describing the location.
Output Class diagram PlantUML code:
        @startuml
            class Take{
                nbr: integer
                filmed_meters : Real
                reel : string
            }
            class Setup{
                code: string
                photographic_pars: Text
            }
            class Scene{
                code: string
                description: Text
            }
            class Internal{
                theater: string
            }
            class External{
                night_scene : boolean
            }
            class Location{
                name: string
                address: string
                description: text
            }

Input Requirements:
    A user can open a new or existing document.
    Text is entered through a keyboard.
    A document is made up of several pages.
    Each page is made up of a header, body and footer.
    Date, time and page number may be added to header or footer.
    Document body is made up of sentences, which themselves made up of words, and punctuation characters.
    Words are made up of letters, digits and/or special characters.
    Pictures and tables may be inserted into the document body.
    Tables are made up of rows and columns and every cell in a table can contain both text and pictures.
    Users can save or print documents.

Type	Symbol	Purpose
Extension	<|--	Specialization of a class in a hierarchy
Implementation	<|..	Realization of an interface by a class
Composition	*--	The part cannot exist without the whole
